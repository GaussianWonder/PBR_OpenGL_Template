# OpenGL Template

This is an OpengGL project start template in c++.

## Build

The following commands will be displayed using an alias:

```bash
alias run="./run.sh"
```

Help menu:

```bash
run help
```

```text
Example:
  run clean build opengl_template
  run opengl_template
  run build
  run clean build
  run clean

  :help   displays this message
  :clean  clean build folder
  :build  build project
  :exec   execute the executable
  :cb     clean build shorthand
```

The run script will take its arguments and execute them sequentially.

There are only 5 **presetted commands**, but custom commands can be provided by path.

Since this is a simple script, i recommend to read it for further customisation and understanding of the build process.
